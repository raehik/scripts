# Deprecated
**This repo is deprecated.** The contents were merged with my dotfiles in
[raehik/dotfiles@ae83bc8](https://github.com/raehik/dotfiles/commit/ae83bc873665cc529fdad5cb958957be1df63029)
(2018-11-25). Scripts have been shuffled since and will continue to do so, so
check my dotfiles history from then to find things. *(e.g. Took me a while to
find out that I moved `ezstring` to `shslug`.)*

The original readme follows. The GitHub repository for this shall be placed into
read-only from 2020-11-12. I don't intend to remove it unless I do a proper
check of what was here.

Assorted scripts
================

This is a storage space for any scripts I've written. All scripts
outside of the `old/` directory are ones I use actively (though exactly
how often that means depends on the script itself).
